    <p> I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)</p>
   <p> Yeah</p>
   <p> To take a stand (To take a stand)</p>
   <p> It's been a ride</p>
   <p> Everybody (Everybody)</p>
   <p> I guess I had to</p>
   <p> Come take my hand (Come take my hand)</p>
   <p> Go to that place to get to this one</p>
   <p> We'll walk this road together, through the storm</p>
   <p> Now some of you</p>
   <p> Whatever weather, cold or warm</p>               
   <p> Might still be in that place</p>
   <p> Just lettin' you know that you're not alone</p>
   <p> If you're tryna get out</p>
   <p> Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road</p>
   <p> Just follow me, I'll get you there</p>

   
   <p> You can try and</p>
   <p> Read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em</p>
   <p> But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em</p>
   <p> 'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem</p>
   <p> When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think</p>
   <p> I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans</p>
   <p> It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me</p>
   <p> I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably</p>
   <p> And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony</p>
   <p> No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he</p>
   <p> From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'</p>
   <p> Whether he's on salary, paid hourly</p>
   <p> Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him</p>
   <p> Whichever comes first, for better or worse, he's married to the game</p>
   <p> Like a "fuck you" for Christmas, his gift is a curse</p>
   <p> Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt</p>
   <p> And fuck the whole universe</p>
   
   <p> I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)</p>
   <p> To take a stand (To take a stand)</p>
   <p> Everybody (Everybody)</p>
   <p> Come take my hand (Come take my hand)</p>
   <p> We'll walk this road together, through the storm</p>
   <p> Whatever weather, cold or warm</p>
   <p> Just lettin' you know that you're not alone</p>
   <p> Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road</p>

   
   <p> Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap</p>
   <p> I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap (Rap)</p>
   <p> You said you was king, you lied through your teeth</p>
   <p> For that, fuck your feelings</p>
   <p> Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped</p>
   <p> And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back</p>
   <p> I promise to never go back on that promise</p>
   <p> In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehh"</p>
   <p> Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground</p>
   <p> Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now</p>
   <p> All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow</p>
   <p> 'Cause I ain't playin' around</p>
   <p> There's a game called circle and I don't know how</p>
   <p> I'm way too up to back down</p>
   <p> But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out</p>
   <p> Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't</p>
   <p> This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around</p>
   <p> But it's time to exorcise these demons</p>
   <p> These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now</p>
   
   <p> I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)</p>
   <p> To take a stand (To take a stand)</p>
   <p> Everybody (Everybody)</p>
   <p> Come take my hand (Come take my hand)</p>
   <p> We'll walk this road together, through the storm</p>
   <p> Whatever weather, cold or warm</p>
   <p> Just lettin' you know that you're not alone</p>
   <p> Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road</p>
   

   <p> And I just can't keep livin' this way</p>
   <p> So startin' today</p>
   <p> I'm breakin' out of this cage</p>
   <p> I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons</p>
   <p> I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground</p>
   <p> I've had enough, now I'm so fed up</p>
   <p> Time to put my life back together right now</p>

   
   <p> It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me</p>
   <p> Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you</p>
   <p> So I could come back a brand-new me</p>
   <p> You helped see me through</p>
   <p> And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you</p>
   <p> I've been through the wringer</p>
   <p> But they can do little to the middle finger</p>
   <p> I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of</p>
   <p> My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers</p>
   <p> And drop dead: no more beef lingers</p>
   <p> No more drama from now on, I promise</p>
   <p> To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father</p>
   <p> So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters</p>
   <p> And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it</p>
   <p> 'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club</p>
   <p> Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up</p>
   <p> 'Cause I'm raisin' the bar</p>
   <p> I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars</p>
   <p> I feel amazin', and I'mâ€”</p>

   <p> I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)</p>
   <p> To take a stand (To take a stand)</p>
   <p> Everybody (Everybody)</p>
   <p> Come take my hand (Come take my hand)</p>
   <p> We'll walk this road together, through the storm</p>
   <p> Whatever weather, cold or warm</p>
   <p> Just lettin' you know that you're not alone</p>
   <p> Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road</p>
